This is the initial stable release of the Multi-Bot RAG Platform. It provides a complete foundation for building and deploying AI-powered chatbots with document-based knowledge retrieval.

**Key Highlights:**
- 🤖 **Multi-LLM Support**: Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI models
- 📄 **Advanced RAG**: Sophisticated document processing and retrieval system
- ⚡ **Real-Time Chat**: WebSocket-powered instant messaging with typing indicators
- 🔒 **Enterprise Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, and data isolation
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive metrics and performance monitoring
- 🐳 **Production Ready**: Full Docker support with deployment guides

**What's Next:**
- Enhanced analytics and reporting features
- Advanced document processing capabilities
- Multi-language support
- Plugin system for custom integrations
- Mobile application support

**Migration Notes:**
This is the first stable release, so no migration is required.

**Breaking Changes:**
None - this is the initial release.

**Known Issues:**
- Large file uploads (>50MB) may timeout in some configurations
- WebSocket connections may occasionally drop in high-load scenarios
- OCR processing is currently limited to English text

**Performance Notes:**
- Recommended minimum 4GB RAM for production deployment
